# v1.3.0

Release Date: October 28, 2025

A major update introducing subscription‑based account models, in‑context chat across apps, and multi‑session conversations per Agent, along with Markdown, Quick Actions, and a better update experience.

### New
- Subscription and account models (no API key needed): Sign in with Apple/Google, browse recommended models, and upgrade in‑app when a model requires it.
- In‑context chat anywhere: Select text in any app and press the hotkey to start a conversation using that selection as context; supports streaming type‑in‑place for instant edits.
- Multiple conversations per Agent: Create, rename, archive, and switch between sessions; presets are reused across sessions.
- Auto‑generated titles: New conversations are named automatically after the first message.

### Improvements
- Replies render as Markdown; while streaming, show clean plain text with a caret indicator. Copy response as Markdown when complete.
- Quick Actions palette (Cmd+K): send/regenerate, copy/paste last reply, run with another Agent, and start a new session.
- Session‑scoped context: context is saved on the session and injected into the system prompt only when sending; user messages stay clean.
- Default model selection: compact pickers with friendly names and recommended models. Custom model instances support Base URL and Keychain token storage.
- App updates: update indicator in the menu and an Update Settings view with release notes and version history. Auto‑checks on launch and when opening settings.
- UI/UX polish: clearer keyboard hints, refined input bar, token usage estimate, and localization updates.

### Fixes
- Resolved duplicate “Open & Chat” windows when triggered rapidly.
- Improved session tab selection, click, and rename behavior.
- Fixed user‑content/context mixing issues.
- Stability and performance improvements across the app.
