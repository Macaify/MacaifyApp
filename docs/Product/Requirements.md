# Requirements Analysis

Primary
- Users log in; if logged in, account credits are default source.
- Plans: Free/Pro/Pro+; plans unlock model sets.
- Users can add multiple custom AI providers; use them per conversation or as default.
- Models list shows lock status and encourages upgrade.
- If a locked model is selected under Account, show upgrade sheet; allow switching to a provider alternative.

Secondary
- Defaults for source/model and new chat behavior.
- Privacy & Advanced: language, proxy/base URL, voice toggle, updates.
- Quota/usage visualization for value perception.

Out of scope (for now)
- Real billing/usage metering; server integration beyond login.
- Organization/team plans.

Constraints
- Keep compatibility with existing model selection and API usage.
- Nonâ€‘destructive changes: preserve existing keys when possible.
