Macaify Usage Notes: Closed‑source allowed, but add attribution

Do what you need: you can modify, commercialize, distribute closed‑source builds, and even run it as a SaaS.

Two things to follow:
- Show this line in a place users can actually see (localize if you want; clickable link is better):
  Powered by Macaify — https://macaify.com
  Typical spots: About/Settings/Info page, Help page, store/download page description, or CLI --about/--version output.
- Keep copyright notices and third‑party licenses/attributions in your distribution.

No endorsement: this attribution does not mean I endorse or warrant your product.

Trademarks: “Macaify” and related marks belong to me. Beyond the attribution above, using the name/logo for product naming, main marketing visuals, or anything that implies affiliation/endorsement requires prior written permission.

Third‑party components: follow their original licenses.

As‑is: the software is provided “as is”, with no warranties of any kind; I’m not liable for issues to the extent permitted by law.
